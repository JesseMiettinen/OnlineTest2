    Currently almost finished with a fairly high intensity mobile development course.
    <br><br>
    Course included learning the basic principles of UX and UI design in addition to the best practices of UX and UI.<br><br>
    I have also e been using Ionic 3 framework for simple mobile app design quite a lot now. This includes setting up the development environment, using mobile app components and implementing the best practices of mobile app design.<br><br>
    I have used firebase to connect database and authentication for mobile app.<br><br>
    Finally I have developed a simple task list app and further enhanced it for a different purpose.
